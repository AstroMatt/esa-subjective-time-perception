How to use Subjective Time Perception software?
===============================================


Running the experiment while connected to the internet
------------------------------------------------------
This is the typical use of the software.

1. Run experiment at http://time.astrotech.io
2. Results will be uploaded automatically.


Running the experiment without access to the internet
-----------------------------------------------------
Offline use is handy for example during:

    - analog simulations with time delay (hence no realtime internet)
    - at public events, conferences, opendays etc. (when you cannot connect machine to the internet)
    - while in travel (airport, train, etc.)

1. Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AstroMatt/esa-time-perception/master/frontend/v3/index.html
2. Open with your browser (double click) ``index.html`` file and run the experiment.
3. When you connect machine to the internet, refresh page and your results will be uploaded.
4. If your computer cannot be connected to the internet:

    1. Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AstroMatt/esa-time-perception/master/frontend/v3/cache.html
    2. Open with your browser (double click) ``cache.html`` file.
    3. Save all this text as a txt (in Notepad, Word or whatever else) file to USB Pendrive.
    4. From the other computer send the results via email: time-perception@astrotech.io
